\chap{The Robot Finds Its Way by Itself}\label{ch.line}

Consider a warehouse with robotic carts that bring objects to a central
dispatching area. There are lines painted on the floor of the warehouse
and the robot receives instructions to follow certain lines until it
reaches the storage bin of the desired object. Let us write a program
that causes the robot to follow a line on the floor.

{\raggedleft \hfill Program file \bu{follow-line.aesl}}

The line-following task brings out all the uncertainty of constructing
robots in the real world. The line might not be perfectly straight, dust
may obscure part of the line, or dirt may cause one wheel to move more
slowly than the other one. To follow a line, the robot must use a
\emph{controller} that decides how much power to apply to each motor
depending on the data received from the sensors.

\sect{The line and the robot}

To follow a line, we use the ground sensors (\cref{ch.moving}). Remember
that these work by sending infrared light (which is invisible to human
eye) and measuring how much is reflected back. If the floor is
light-colored, the sensor will detect a lot of reflected light and the
event \blksm{lots-of-light} will occur. We need a line that will cause
an event to occur when there is little reflected light
\blksm{little-light}. This is easy to do by printing a black line on
paper and taping it to the floor or by attaching black electrician's
tape on the floor (\cref{fig.tape}). The line must be wide enough so
that both ground sensors will sense black when the robot is successfully
following the line. A width of 5 centimeters is sufficient for the robot
to follow the line even if there are small deviations.

\end{figure}

To implement line-following, first, we cause the robot to move forward
whenever \emph{both} sensors detect a dark surface---it is on the
line---and to stop whenever \emph{both} sensors detect a light
surface---it is not on the line. See \cref{fig.start-stop}.

\trickbox{Make sure that you use a USB cable that is long enough (say,
two meters), so that the Thymio can stay connected to the computer even
as it moves. You can find extension cables in any computer shop.}

\sect{Your first controller}

The next step is to program the controller that follows the line. Two
event-actions pairs are needed (Figure~\cref{fig.follow-line}).

\begin{itemize}

\item If the robot moves off the tape to the \emph{left}
(\cref{fig.one-off}), the \emph{left} sensor will detect the floor while
the \emph{right} sensor is still detecting the tape; the robot must
turn slightly to the \emph{right}.

\item If the robot moves off the tape to the \emph{right}, the
\emph{right} sensor will detect the floor while the \emph{left} sensor
is still detecting the tape; the robot must turn slightly
to the \emph{left}.

\end{itemize}

%Two event-actions pairs are needed, as shown in \cref{fig.follow-line}.

\sect{Setting the parameters}

It is easy to see that if the robot runs off the left edge of the tape,
it has to turn to the right (\cref{fig.one-off}). The question is
how tight should the turn be? If the turn is too gentle, the right
sensor might \emph{also} run off the tape before the robot turns back;
if the turn is too sharp, it might cause the robot to run off the
other end of the tape. In any case, sharp turns can be dangerous to
the robot and cause whatever it is carrying to fall off.

You will need to experiment with the speeds of the left and right motors
in each motor action block until the robot runs \emph{reliably}. Here,
reliably means that the robot can successfully follow the line several
times. Since each time you place the robot on the line you might place
it at a slightly different position and point it in a slightly different
direction, you need to run several tests to make sure that the program
works.

The forward speed of the robot on the line is also an important
parameter. If it is too fast, the robot can run off the line before the
turning actions can affect its direction. If the speed is too slow, no
one will buy your robot to use in a warehouse.

\exercisebox{\thechapter.1}{The robot stops when both ground sensors
detect that they are off the tape. Modify the program so that the robot
makes a gentle left turn in an attempt to find the tape again. Try it on
a tape with a left turn like the one shown in \cref{fig.tape}. Try
increasing the forward speed of the robot. What happens when the robot
gets to the end of the tape?}

\bigskip

\exercisebox{\thechapter.2}{Modify the program from the previous
exercise so that the robot turns right when it runs off the tape. What
happens?
\vspace{.5em}\\
It would be nice if we could \emph{remember} which sensor was the last
one to lose contact with the tape in order to cause the robot turn in
the correct direction to find the tape again. In \cref{ch.states} we
will learn how Thymio can remember information.}

\bigskip

\exercisebox{\thechapter.3}{
Experiment with different arrangements of the lines of tapes:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nosep,leftmargin=*]
\item Gentle turns;
\item Sharp turns;
\item Zigzagging lines;
\item Wider lines;
\item Narrow lines.
\end{itemize}
Run competitions with your friends: Whose robot successfully follows the
most lines? For each line, whose robot follows it in the shortest time?

\exercisebox{\thechapter.4}{
Discuss what effect the following modifications to the Thymio would
have on the ability of the robot to follow a line:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nosep,leftmargin=*]
\item Ground sensing events occur more often or less often.
\item The sensors are further apart or closer together.
\item There are more than two ground sensors on the bottom of the robot.
\end{itemize}
