\chap{A Pet Robot}\label{ch.pet}

The robots we build in this chapter are \emph{autonomous robots}.
They display independent behavior that is normally associated with
living things like cats and dogs. The behavior is achieved by
\textit{feedback}: the robot will sense that something occurs in the
world and modify its behavior accordingly.

\sect{The robot obeys you}

We will program the robot to obey: the robot stays in place without
moving, but when it detects your hand in front of it, it moves towards
your hand.

{\raggedleft \hfill Program file \bu{obeys.aesl}}

There are five horizontal distance sensors on the front of the Thymio
robot and two on the rear. They are similar to the ones under Thymio
that we used in \cref{ch.moving}. Bring your hand slowly towards the
sensors; when it gets close, a red light will appear around the sensors
that detect your hands (\cref{fig.detect}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\gr{detect}{.5}
\caption{The front of the Thymio. Two sensors detect the fingers.}\label{fig.detect}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The block \blksm{event-prox} is used to sense if something is close to
a sensor or not. In either case it causes an event to occur. The small
squares in the block (five on the front and two on the rear) are used to specify
when an event occurs. Clicking on a square changes it from gray to white
to black and back to gray. The meaning of these colors is:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gray}: The sensor is not used.
\item \textbf{White}: An event occurs when there is a lot of reflected
light.\label{p.proximity-colors2}.
\item \textbf{Black}: An event occurs when there is little reflected
light.
\end{itemize}

If you wish an event to occur when an object is close to the sensor, use
a white square because the object will reflect a lot of light. If you
wish an event to occur when no object is close to the sensor, use a
black square because little light will be reflected.

%\importantbox[Ground sensors and horizontal sensors]{
%Be careful not to confuse the behavior of the horizontal
%sensors with the behavior of the ground sensors.
%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nosep,leftmargin=*]
%\item For the horizontal sensors, the white square specifies that an
%event will occur if there is \emph{nothing nearby}, while the red square
%specifies that an event will occur if there is \emph{something nearby}.
%\item For the ground sensors, the white square specifies that an event
%will occur if \emph{only a little light is reflected from the surface},
%while the red square specifies that an event will occur \emph{if a lot
%of light is reflected from the surface}.
%\end{itemize}
%The physical principle of these two types of sensors is similar, but because of their different placement their behavior is different.
%}\label{page.sensors}

To implement the required behavior, we need the two event-actions pairs
(\cref{fig.follow-hand}). In the first pair, the center front sensor is
black and the associated action is that the motors are off. Therefore,
when the robot does not detect an object, it will not move, and it will
stop if it had been moving. In the second pair, the center front sensor
is white and the sliders of the motor block are dragged to the top.
Therefore, when you bring your hand near the front of the robot, an
event occurs that causes both motors to run quite fast and the robot to
move forward.

\sect{Steering the Thymio robot}

The Thymio robot does not have a steering wheel like a car or a
handlebar like a bicycle. So how can it turn? The robot uses
\emph{differential drive}, which is familiar from tracked vehicles like
the bulldozer (\cref{fig.bull}). Instead of turning a handlebar a
desired direction, the left and right tracks or wheels are driven by
individual motors at \emph{different} speeds. If the right track moves
faster than the left one, the vehicle turns left, and if the left track
moves faster than the right one, the vehicle turns right.

Differential drive for the Thymio robot is implemented by setting the
left and right sliders of a motor action block, and therefore the wheel
speeds, to different values. The greater the difference between the
speeds, the tighter the turn. To achieve a large difference of speeds,
drive one track forward and one track backwards. In fact, if one
track moves forward at a certain speed, while the other track moves
backwards at the same speed, the Thymio turns in place. For example, in
the motor action block \blksm{differential}, the left slider has been
set for fast speed backwards, while the right slider has been set for
fast speed forwards. The result is that the robot will turn to the left.

Experiment with an event-actions pair such as: \blkc{turning}

Set the left and right sliders, run the program and touch the center
button; to stop the robot click on \blksm{stop}. Now you can change the
sliders and try again.

\trickbox{The small image of Thymio in the center of the motor action
block shows an animation of the movement of the robot when you move the
sliders. When the animation stops, the image shows the direction in
which the robot will move when this action block is run.}

\sect{The robot likes you}

A real pet follows you around. To make the robot follow your hand, add
two additional event-actions pairs: if the robot detects an object in
front of its left-most sensor, it turns to the left, while if it detects
an object in front of its right-most sensor, it turns to the right.
                                                       
{\raggedleft \hfill Program file \bu{likes.aesl}}

The program for the robot that likes you consists of two event-actions
pairs (\cref{fig.likes}). Experiment with the sliders on each motor
action block.

\exercisebox{\thechapter.1}{ Modify the behaviour of the robot so
that it moves forward when the program is run and stops when it
detects the edge of a table (or a strip of black tape).}

\newpage

As explained in \cref{ch.moving}, a lot of light will be reflected from
a white surface, while very little light will be reflected from a black
surface. You will have to experiment with the horizontal sensor block to
determine when to click on a white square and when on a black square,
depending on the floor or table where you place the robot.

\exercisebox{\thechapter.2}{ What happens if you change the order of the
event-actions pairs that you used in the previous exercise? }

\sect{The robot doesn't like you}

Sometimes your pet may be in a bad mood and turn away from your hand.
Write a program that causes this behavior in the robot.

{\raggedleft \hfill Program file \bu{does-not-like.aesl}}

Open the program for the pet that likes you and exchange the association
of the events with the actions. Detection of an object by the left
sensor causes the robot to turn right, while detection of an object by
the right sensor causes the robot to turn left (\cref{fig.hates}).

\exercisebox{\thechapter.3} { The front horizontal sensors are numbered
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 from the left of the robot to its right. The rear sensors
are numbered 5 for the left one and 6 for the right one. Instead of
using sensors 0 and 4 as before:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nosep,leftmargin=*]
\item Use sensors 1 and 3 to turn the robot left and right, respectively.
\item Use both sensors 0 and 1 to turn the robot left and both sensors 3
and 4 to turn the robot right.
\item Add event-actions pairs for the rear sensors 5 and 6.
\end{itemize}
}

\sect{Setting the sliders precisely (advanced topic)}\label{s.sliders}

It is difficult to set the sliders precisely so that, for example, both
motors run at the same speed. We can use the translation of the
event-actions pairs into a textual program to improve the precision.
\Cref{fig.textcode} shows the program (where the pet likes you and
follows you around) along with the text translation at the right of the
VPL window. This text is modified automatically as you move the sliders.

\begin{figure}

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.6\textwidth}

\begin{lstlisting}
onevent prox
	if prox.horizontal[2] < 1000 then
		motor.left.target = 0
		motor.right.target = 0
	end
	if prox.horizontal[2] > 2000 then
		motor.left.target = 300
		motor.right.target = 300
	end
	if prox.horizontal[0] > 2000 then
		motor.left.target = -300
		motor.right.target = 300
	end
	if prox.horizontal[4] > 2000 then
		motor.left.target = 300
		motor.right.target = -300
	end
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\caption{A VPL program and the corresponding text program.}
\label{fig.textcode}
\end{figure}

\p{onevent prox} means: whenever the event of sampling the horizontal
distance sensors (the \emph{proximity} sensors, abbreviated \emph{prox})
occurs , the instructions on the following lines before \p{end} will be
run. The proximity event occurs 10 times a second.

When the event happens, the values of the sensors are checked using a
condition. Sensor number 2 (front center) is checked first:
\p{prox.horizontal[2]}. If this value is lower than 1000, the speeds of
the left and right motors are set to 0 using the instructions:

\begin{verbatim}
motor.left.target  = 0
motor.right.target = 0
\end{verbatim}

Every block \verb+if ... then ... end+ tests a specific sensor and runs
the associated instructions the result of test is true. The programs
executes the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}[start=0,noitemsep,nosep]
\item tests if nothing is in front; if that is true, the robot stops.
\item tests if something is in front; if that is true, the robot goes forward.
\item tests if there is something at left; if that is true, the robot turns left.
\item tests if there is something at right; if that is true, the robot turns right.
\end{enumerate}

Once all the sensors have been read and the appropriate action is
performed, the program waits for the next event \p{prox} and starts
these tests again. This happens again and again until the program is
stopped.

To write programs in text mode, use the AsebaStudio environment
(\cref{ch.next}).

\trickbox{By moving the sliders on the motor action blocks, you will see
that the target speeds of the motors (\p{moter.X.target}) jump by steps
of 50 in the range $-$500 to 500. By moving the sliders carefully, you
can set the speeds to any of these values.}
